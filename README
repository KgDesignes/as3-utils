Utils for AS3 Development.
Author: Alan Reyes AKA "Kutt Katrea" <kutt.katrea@kgdesignes.net>

Currently, there is only the Console class which lets you forward debbugging 
messages to Firebug Console.

To use this class you must copy the lib/net.kgdesignes.utils.swc file to your lib
folder in your AS3 project, and import the class "net.kgdesignes.utils.Console"
After that, you can use this class statically:

Console.log('Your debbugging message here');

When sending to Firebug, the Console class will prepend a "[FLASH]" label, to the
message, to know where it come from.

To manually compile the library, you need to have in your PATH environment variable
the Flex SDK's bin directory.
If you don't have it (and yoou don't want to add it globally) you can create a file
called 'build-uservars.bat' or 'build-uservars.sh' (depending of your OS) and write
in it an instruction like:

set PATH=C:\PATH\TO\FLEX\SDK\bin;%PATH%
(Windows)

export PATH=/path/to/flex/sdk/bin/:$PATH
(Linux)

Then, run the build.bat/build.sh script.
